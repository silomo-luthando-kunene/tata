# Tata Virtual Job Sim - GenAI Powered Data Analytics
Completed through The Forage (https://www.theforage.com/)

## 🎯 Project Overview: AI-Powered Credit Delinquency Analytics
Organization: Tata iQ (Tata Group).
Client: Geldium Finance (Financial Services).
Role: AI Transformation Consultant

Geldium Finance faced rising credit card delinquency rates (payments >30 days late). Their existing collections process was reactive, relying on manual case handling and historical trends. The goal was to transition Geldium from a manual outreach model to a proactive, predictive and AI-driven intervention strategy to reduce credit card delinquency. 

In this simulation, GenAI was leveraged to:
* Accelerate the development of predictive machine learning model logic and feature engineering.
* Automate the synthesis of customer risk patterns.
* Develop operational strategies to mitigate delinquency.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
* **Data Science:** Feature Engineering, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Predictive Modeling.
* **Tools:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebooks, Generative AI (LLMs for code/logic generation) and Microsoft PowerPoint.
* **Soft Skills:** Business and Strategic Communication.

## 📈 Key Tasks & Contributions
1. **Task 1: Data Discovery** - Analyzed client datasets to identify trends.
2. **Task 2: Prototyping** - Developed a model achieving a [X]% accuracy rate.
3. **Task 3: Insights** - Translated technical findings into a slide deck for stakeholders.
