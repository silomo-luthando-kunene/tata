# Tata Virtual Job Sim - GenAI Powered Data Analytics
Completed through The Forage (https://www.theforage.com/)

## 🎯 Project Overview: AI-Powered Credit Delinquency Analytics
Organization: Tata.
Client: Geldium Finance (Financial Services).
Role: AI Transformation Consultant

Geldium Finance faced rising credit card delinquency rates (payments >30 days late). Their existing collections process was reactive, relying on manual case handling and historical trends. The goal was to transition Geldium from a manual outreach model to a proactive, predictive and AI-driven intervention strategy to reduce credit card delinquency. 

In this simulation, GenAI was leveraged to:
* Accelerate the development of predictive machine learning model logic and feature engineering.
* Automate the synthesis of customer risk patterns.
* Develop operational strategies to mitigate delinquency.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
* **Data Science:** Feature Engineering, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Predictive Modeling.
* **Tools:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebooks, Generative AI (LLMs for code/logic generation) and Microsoft PowerPoint.
* **Soft Skills:** Business and Strategic Communication.

## 📈 Key Tasks & Contributions
1. **Task 1: **Objective:** - Evaluated the integrity of Geldium’s financial datasets via Exploratory Data Analysis techniques to establish a reliable foundation for delinquency modeling. 
2. **Task 2: Predictive Model Prototyping & Logic Design** - Architected a delinquency prediction pipeline using GenAI to compare Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models, ultimately selecting a Random Forest approach for its balance of high predictive power and feature interpretability.
3. **Task 3: Strategic Insights & Ethical AI Governance** - Synthesized predictive model outputs into a stakeholder-ready report, identifying high-risk customer segments and translating data trends into a SMART recommendation framework.
4. **Task 4: Agentic AI System Design & Executive Briefing** - Architected a proposal for an autonomous, agentic AI debt-management system that automates personalized customer outreach while maintaining "human-in-the-loop" oversight for high-risk escalations. Developed a comprehensive executive presentation outlining the system's learning loops, regulatory guardrails, and expected business KPIs, emphasizing the transition from static modeling to adaptive, real-time risk mitigation.
